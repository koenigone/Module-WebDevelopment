# Web Development Accessibility Lab

Demo site for testing in Lighthouse.

Use the pages in this repo and the guide in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mustbebuilt/webDevAccessibilityLab/wiki/01.-A11Y-and-Lighthouse) to test pages for accessibility (A11Y).  

This will be done with the Google Chrome Lighthouse feature that requires pages to be either run via Visual Studio Code [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or by cloning this GitHub and using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
